        Youth protest against the Vietnam War was the crystallization point for the 1968 movement in the Federal Republic. On February 17, 1968, Rudi Dutschke, the most famous member of the West German student movement, addressed participants in the International Vietnam Congress held at West Berlin's Technical University. Dutschke was one of the event's co-organizers. Photo by Klaus Lehnartz.

- **approaches to the artefacts**

    1. analysis of political rhetorics and personal character through journalist photography. (**method: content** - what is in the photograph?)

    2. analysis of the “speaker-audience-place” relationships and their exchange through journalist photography. (**method: form** - how are the photograph?)

    3. to question and examine the value of photography in political events, in terms of preservation of information. (**method: form** of form - what is it about *photograph*?)

    a. What has the the photographical strategy done/added to the information?

    b. What has the materiality, the physical quality of photography and the age-ing of the material done/added/reduced to the information?

    - deconstruction

        Did these photograph already deconstructed the reality? Am I re-deconstructing it again by my narrative, by picking out elements and breaking up the context? Collecting, rehabilitating. Reality, events. They are unstuck. (thinking loud)

    - physical quality of photography

        This is Louis de Visser at Toespraak voor de afdeling Haarlem. The blurry image of his arm waving in the air indicates the movement. The scratch, the stains (on his pants) and the left over image (frame of a gate vanishing into the darkness) on the photograph somehow promote the tension.

        Tijdens de toespraak van Dutschke op de bijeenkomst tegen de Vietnam-oorlog in Krasnapolski ontploft een rookbom. We can only see half of a right arm of (possibly) Rudi Dutschke. We don't know how he reacted and what he was speaking, when the smoke bomb exploded. But we guess he wanted to calm people down with this hand gesture. We can imagine he was saying something with deterrence by seeing how the audience looked at him. **The photograph, in a way is about the impossibility of revealing, but at the same time shows the possibility of inventory, imagination based on given evidence.**

        This video clip showing Mussolini Speaking is from AP Archive: [http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork](http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork). The shaky image (especially at the beginning of the film, when Mussolini walked to the front) and the lighting on his eyes is intriguing, intimidating and terrifying. The

        Alida de Jong at a speech. What is missing on the bottom left, in the triangle? The way people used to store a photograph has caused a damage to the material and a loss to the information. Certain archival methods have certain patterns. In this case, it is about triangle.

    - in relation the topic: *why politik toespraak?*

        Photograph of politik toespraak gives out information of the event on a very minimal level. 

        If we want to investigate architecture, we look at photographs of them and we know how they are built up. If we research about fashion, photographs of the clothing provides enough.

        However, Political speeches are less about still visuals. They are about what they SPEAK about (audio, text). 

        What is the value of the photograph then? The archival value and functionality of photography for political speeches is interesting. 

        The materiality's contribution has a bigger proportion to the information.

- transcoding

    ## How do I transcode?

    - To preserve as much as possible the physical quality?
    - Is the physical quality valuable because it indicates the history, methodology in the history and the historical context of the reality it represents?
